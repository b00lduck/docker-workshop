Excercise 3

Build the "provider" and "consumer" docker-images tagged with "provider:latest" and "consumer:latest".

Create a docker-compose.yml file that:
 * uses the version "2" of docker-compose format
 * starts the "consumer" image and exposes its port 80
 * starts the "provider" image

Start the compose-file and test the result.

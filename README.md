# Docker-workshop 14.11.2016

## Excercise 1:

 - Create a Dockerfile for a precompiled statically linked binary: "provider/provider"
 - Use "scratch" as the base image
 - The service provides an HTTP server on port 8080, be sure that it will be accessible
 - Processes in docker-containers should not be started as root for security reasons
